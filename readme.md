# LoadBalancer controllers  
Clone this repository anywhere.  
git checkout nginx or haproxy depending on the situation.  
Run the fix to allow nginx/haproxy to connect to ports lower than 1024 without sudo.  
Use start/stop/restart & enjoy.  
If you have a better way to isolate nginx/haproxy for killing,  
**I would be greatly appreciative of pull requests to improve them.**
